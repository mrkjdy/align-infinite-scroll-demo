This is a Next.js project that I developed to demo infinite scrolling with
content from [Pexels](https://pexels.com).

I deployed it to Vercel, you can check it out here: https://align-infinite-scroll-demo.vercel.app/

If you'd like to run it locally, be sure to create a `.env.local` and add a
`PEXELS_API_KEY`. From there you can just `npm run dev`.
